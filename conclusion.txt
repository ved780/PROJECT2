✅ Conclusion

This is a phishing email using:

    Email spoofing

    Urgent language

    Fake domain & insecure link

    Suspicious attachment

    Social engineering tactics

If a user clicked that link or opened the PDF, they’d likely get redirected to a fake Netflix login page — and their credentials would be stolen.
💡 What I Learned

    This task made me realize how convincing phishing emails can look, especially if you're not trained to spot small signs. Even the sender name and logos were faked — but just hovering over the link or checking the domain gives it away. The header analysis was especially cool — SPF and DKIM checks are powerful tools.
